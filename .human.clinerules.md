# M4300 API Helpers - Simplified Project Rules

## Core Principles

1. Always validate before acting:
   - Before using any tool:
     * Verify tool parameters are correct
     * Ensure tool is appropriate for task
     * Check potential impact
     * Have error handling plan
   
   - Before running any command:
     * Verify command syntax
     * Check command safety
     * Ensure proper permissions
     * Consider potential side effects
   
   - Before starting any sequence:
     * Verify steps are in correct order
     * Ensure prerequisites are met
     * Check for dependencies
     * Have rollback plan
   
   - General validation rules:
     * Never assume success without verification
     * Document validation results
     * Handle all error cases
     * Test with real data when possible

2. Trust testing over documentation:
   - Live API testing is the source of truth
   - Document any differences from official docs
   - Always test with a real switch
   - Keep our own API documentation updated

3. Follow the OODA workflow for all tasks:
   - Observe: Gather facts and current state
   - Orient: Analyze information and impact
   - Decide: Plan approach and steps
   - Ask: Before executing any actions, ask for confirmation
   - Act: Execute steps and validate results

## Development Requirements

1. API Helper Modules:
   - Must implement all core modules:
     * Authentication
     * Device Management
     * Diagnostics
     * LAG
     * Logging
     * Multicast
     * PoE
     * Port Management
     * QoS
     * Routing
     * STP
     * VLAN Management
   - Each module requires:
     * Live API validation
     * Complete testing
     * Error handling
     * MCP integration
     * Documentation
     * Example code

2. Code Standards:
   - Use Poetry for dependency management
   - Include type hints
   - Write docstrings
   - Follow PEP 8
   - No global variables
   - No bare except clauses
   - Handle all errors properly

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Unit tests for all helpers
   - Integration tests with real responses
   - Test all error cases
   - Validate all configurations
   - No failing tests in main branch

4. Documentation Needs:
   - README with setup guide
   - Module documentation
   - Configuration examples
   - Error handling guide
   - API behavior notes
   - Track any API deviations

5. Security Rules:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Handle sensitive data properly
   - Implement rate limiting
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - No debug mode in production

## Development Workflow

1. Environment Setup:
   - Use Poetry virtual environment
   - Enable pre-commit hooks
   - Configure VSCode integration

2. Version Control:
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Use feature branches
   - No direct commits to main
   - No merges with main unless all tests pass

3. Sequential Changes:
   - Make only one code change per testing cycle
   - Complete testing of current change before making another
   - No batching of multiple changes together
   - Address only one error at a time
   - Complete fix and validation for current error before moving to next
   - No parallel error fixing
   - Each error gets its own complete testing cycle
   - Document each change and its validation results

   Validation Script Usage:
   - Run validate_endpoint.sh before implementing any endpoint
     * Validates API behavior
     * Documents actual responses
     * Identifies discrepancies from docs
   
   - Run validate_helper.sh as completion checkpoint
     * Verifies module structure
     * Checks code requirements (dataclasses, type hints, docstrings)
     * Validates test coverage (unit and integration)
     * Confirms documentation completeness
     * Verifies MCP integration
     * Must pass ALL checks before moving to next endpoint
   
   - General Validation Rules:
     * Save all validation outputs for reference
     * Address any failures immediately
     * Fix all warnings, no exceptions
     * Never skip validation steps
     * No moving forward until checkpoint passes
   
   MCP Operations:
   - Execute only one MCP operation at a time
   - Validate all parameters before using MCP tools
   - Wait for confirmation after each operation
   - Handle all MCP errors explicitly
   - Document all MCP interactions
   - No chaining of MCP operations without validation

   Version Control Workflow:
   - Create one branch per endpoint being implemented/fixed
   - Use clear, searchable commit messages: [endpoint] what changed
   - Commit before making any changes to preserve state
   - Commit after each successful change
   - Use git reset --hard HEAD to revert problematic changes
   - Complete endpoint validation before merging to main
   - Delete branch after successful merge

   Scope Control:
   - Stay focused on current endpoint implementation/fix
   - No parallel feature development
   - No infrastructure changes while fixing endpoints
   - Propose major changes as separate tasks
   - Keep changes minimal and focused

   Troubleshooting Workflow:
   - Before Making Changes:
     * Create a snapshot of working state (git commit or backup)
     * Document the specific issue being addressed
     * Write down why this change should fix it
     * List any code areas that might be affected
     * Map dependencies of the change

   - Error Classification:
     * Categorize each error (syntax, logic, integration, etc.)
     * Prioritize fundamental errors over dependent ones
     * Maintain an error log with categories and relationships
     * Fix independent issues before dependent ones

   - Testing Process:
     * Define minimum test requirements for each change
     * Include both positive and negative test cases
     * Test the specific fix
     * Test potentially affected areas
     * Verify no regression in working features

   - Verification Steps:
     * Run unit tests for changed code
     * Run integration tests if interfaces affected
     * Verify error is actually fixed
     * Check error logs for new issues
     * Document test results

   - If New Issues Appear:
     * Stop immediately
     * Document new issues
     * Revert to last working state
     * Reassess approach
     * Start process over with new understanding

4. Implementation Process:
   - Validate API endpoints first
   - Document actual responses
   - Create helper module
   - Write tests
   - Update documentation

5. Release Process:
   - Verify all helpers work
   - Ensure tests pass
   - Check documentation
   - Validate security
   - Test example code
   - Tag version
   - Lock dependencies
   - Update README and changelog

## Deferred Features

The following features are planned for post-release:
- Performance monitoring
- Extended documentation
- Container support
- CI/CD pipeline
- OWASP compliance
- Accessibility features
- Load testing

## Communication Guidelines

1. Questions and Responses:
   - Treat questions as information requests only
   - Provide analysis without immediate action
   - Wait for explicit action directives
   - Keep responses concise when possible
   - Use OODA format for complex problems only

2. Documentation Updates:
   - Keep API documentation current
   - Document all limitations
   - Note any undocumented features
   - Track all API deviations
   - Include practical examples
