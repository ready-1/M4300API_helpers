# Task Context
Task Name: MCP Server Implementation
Branch: feature/mcp-server
Previous State: Architecture and rules documentation complete
Next Steps: Create and configure MCP server

# OODA Analysis
## OBSERVE
- Current Implementation State:
  * No MCP server exists yet
  * Architecture doc defines server requirements
  * Need to support M4300 API development
- Documentation Review:
  * M4300 API docs available in PDF and YAML
  * Architecture specifies 4-hour implementation timeline
  * Task transition format defined
- Live API State:
  * Test switch available at 192.168.99.92
  * Port 50 available for testing
  * Will need real API responses

## ORIENT
- Architecture Considerations:
  * Server will provide documentation access
  * Code generation capabilities needed
  * Must integrate with Cline extension
- Dependencies:
  * MCP SDK for TypeScript
  * M4300 API documentation
  * Test environment access

## DECIDE
- Approach:
  * Create standalone TypeScript MCP server
  * Load and serve M4300 documentation
  * Implement basic code generation
  * Add documentation lookup tools
- Implementation Steps:
  1. Create server project using MCP SDK
  2. Add documentation loading
  3. Implement basic tools
  4. Test with Cline extension
  5. Add code generation features

## ACT
- Completed Actions:
  * Created basic MCP server project
  * Set up in /Users/bob/Documents/Cline/MCP
  * Added documentation loading
  * Implemented lookup_endpoint tool
  * Installed dependencies
  * Built server successfully

- Next Action:
  * Test the server with Cline extension
  * Add code generation capabilities
  * Implement additional tools

# Validation Requirements
- Critical Rules Checked:
  * MCP_OPERATION_REQUIREMENTS
  * DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS requirements
  * VALIDATION_SCRIPT_REQUIREMENTS
- Validation Scripts:
  * N/A for initial setup
- Test Coverage:
  * Will add tests after basic implementation

# Environment State
- Active Branches:
  * feature/mcp-server
- Running Services:
  * None yet
- Test Environment:
  * Test switch available
  * Documentation files accessible
